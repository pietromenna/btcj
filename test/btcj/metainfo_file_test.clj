; Metainfo File Structure
;========================
; All data in a metainfo file is bencoded. The specification for bencoding is defined above.

; The content of a metainfo file (the file ending in ".torrent") is a bencoded dictionary, containing the keys listed below. All character string values are UTF-8 encoded.

; info: a dictionary that describes the file(s) of the torrent. There are two possible forms: one for the case of a 'single-file' torrent with no directory structure, and one for the case of a 'multi-file' torrent (see below for details)
; announce: The announce URL of the tracker (string)
; announce-list: (optional) this is an extention to the official specification, offering backwards-compatibility. (list of lists of strings).
; The official request for a specification change is here.
; creation date: (optional) the creation time of the torrent, in standard UNIX epoch format (integer, seconds since 1-Jan-1970 00:00:00 UTC)
; comment: (optional) free-form textual comments of the author (string)
; created by: (optional) name and version of the program used to create the .torrent (string)
; encoding: (optional) the string encoding format used to generate the pieces part of the info dictionary in the .torrent metafile (string)
; Info Dictionary
; This section contains the field which are common to both mode, "single file" and "multiple file".
; piece length: number of bytes in each piece (integer)
; pieces: string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values, one per piece (byte string, i.e. not urlencoded)
; private: (optional) this field is an integer. If it is set to "1", the client MUST publish its presence to get other peers ONLY via the trackers explicitly described in the metainfo file. If this field is set to "0" or is not present, the client may obtain peer from other means, e.g. PEX peer exchange, dht. Here, "private" may be read as "no external peer source".
; NOTE: There is much debate surrounding private trackers.
; The official request for a specification change is here.
; Azureus was the first client to respect private trackers, see their wiki for more details.
; Info in Single File Mode
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; For the case of the single-file mode, the info dictionary contains the following structure:

; name: the filename. This is purely advisory. (string)
; length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
; md5sum: (optional) a 32-character hexadecimal string corresponding to the MD5 sum of the file. This is not used by BitTorrent at all, but it is included by some programs for greater compatibility.

(fact (metainfo_info_pieces_length single_file_mode_test) => 16384 )

(fact (metainfo_well_formed single_file_mode_test) => true )


; Info in Multiple File Mode
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; For the case of the multi-file mode, the info dictionary contains the following structure:

; name: the file path of the directory in which to store all the files. This is purely advisory. (string)
; files: a list of dictionaries, one for each file. Each dictionary in this list contains the following keys:
; length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
; md5sum: (optional) a 32-character hexadecimal string corresponding to the MD5 sum of the file. This is not used by BitTorrent at all, but it is included by some programs for greater compatibility.
; path: a list containing one or more string elements that together represent the path and filename. Each element in the list corresponds to either a directory name or (in the case of the final element) the filename. For example, a the file "dir1/dir2/file.ext" would consist of three string elements: "dir1", "dir2", and "file.ext". This is encoded as a bencoded list of strings such as l4:dir14:dir28:file.exte
; Notes
; The piece length specifies the nominal piece size, and is usually a power of 2. The piece size is typically chosen based on the total amount of file data in the torrent, and is constrained by the fact that too-large piece sizes cause inefficiency, and too-small piece sizes cause large .torrent metadata file. Historically, piece size was chosen to result in a .torrent file no greater than approx. 50 - 75 kB (presumably to ease the load on the server hosting the torrent files).
; Current best-practice is to keep the piece size to 512KB or less, for torrents around 8-10GB, even if that results in a larger .torrent file. This results in a more efficient swarm for sharing files. The most common sizes are 256 kB, 512 kB, and 1 MB.
; Every piece is of equal length except for the final piece, which is irregular. The number of pieces is thus determined by 'ceil( total length / piece size )'.
; For the purposes of piece boundaries in the multi-file case, consider the file data as one long continuous stream, composed of the concatenation of each file in the order listed in the files list. The number of pieces and their boundaries are then determined in the same manner as the case of a single file. Pieces may overlap file boundaries.
; Each piece has a corresponding SHA1 hash of the data contained within that piece. These hashes are concatenated to form the pieces value in the above info dictionary. Note that this is not a list but rather a single string. The length of the string must be a multiple of 20.
